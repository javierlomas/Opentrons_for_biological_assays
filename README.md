Opentrons_for_biological_assays

Hi there!

This is a repository showing a bunch of scripts in Python for the Opentrons OT-2 performed in a laboratory of a research center of a Spanish pharmaceutical company in Barcelona, all done by me, Javier Lomas (Senior Scientist).

I hope you enjoy as much as I did.

Best,

Javier Lomas
